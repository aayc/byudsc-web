Structure for Technique Admin

host-technique-admin.py
technique-admin.html

The technique admin has two functions

Article Creator

 latex-like editor to show you what your article looks like (in an iFrame).  Has a preview and a save button.

Management

  shows a listbox of all categories, and the articles below them.  User has the option of deleting a category, or deleting an article, by selecting and clicking “Delete” and a confirm dialog will pop up.  If confirmed, the article is wiped out of the json.

These creators read off of a json file - which is read in as a json object and stringified back to the file by Python.

How to save and when to build?  run python update-techniques.py
Also keep backups of the json file
So is it that whenever you click save, it saves json and builds!?  probably.

“Save and update website”
