Thank you for opening this file!  If you're not a developer of the website, you don't need to worry about this.

Frequently Asked Questions

How do I run this thing!?!

To run the website:  go to your terminal, cd to the root directory (with index.js in it) and type “node index.js”.  Navigate to localhost:4004 and you will arrive at the website.

How do I add a new event to the page?

There’s a google spreadsheet in the byu.dsc@gmail.com account.  Post your event in there, make sure it’s valid HTML in the content page.

Why is the events page so slow?

Because it’s authenticating into the Google Spreadsheets API.  I used to keep a raw JSON file but it’s hard to update, and fragile.  That’s what the admin was for. 

What is admin-OLD?

It was an experiment to have really fast events page loading, where people could edit and delete and add events to the page.  It was getting too complicated though, so I decided to use Google Spreadsheets API.

Why aren't you using AngularJS or React?  Why Jquery?

Because I intend this website to be relatively simple.  This isn't a webapp, this is a website.  Lighter, cleaner, easier to debug.

What is this semantic stuff?

Semantic UI is a CSS framework that makes things look pretty and helps organize the HTML.  I felt that this was a worthwhile addition, and it's fairly lightweight.  If you want to establish a new theme, read the docs.  Note that you'll need a globally installed Nodejs (including npm) and gulp.  Gulp also requires a local install too (I know, it's lame.  Sorry.)

If you want to rebuild the dist css, enter the semantic directory and type "gulp build".  I was new to Semantic, so everything I know is in the docs.  They're not bad.

Why not Python for the backend?

I know most of the team knows python, so I heavily considered using Django for this website.  But I figured that a higher proportion of web people know Javascript than proportion of python people in DSC club know websites with Python.

Who are you?  How do I reach you?

My name is Aaron Chan, I'm a junior (secretly a freshman) at BYU, and I'm probably on a mission right now, otherwise I'd be the one maintaining the website.  Sorry.  I'm trying to write everything I know into documentation like this.  Jacob (head of DSC club atm) will probably be well-informed about this by myself, but he's graduating.  Hopefully the code is clear enough for you.  I tried to make it as semantic and logical as possible.
