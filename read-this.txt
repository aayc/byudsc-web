Thank you for opening this file!  If you're not a developer of the website, you don't need to worry about this.

Frequently Asked Questions

1.  Why aren't you using AngularJS or React?  Why Jquery?

Because I intend this website to be relatively simple.  This isn't a webapp, this is a website.  Lighter, cleaner, simpler, easier to debug, easier to work with.

2.  What is this semantic stuff?

Semantic UI is a CSS framework that makes things look pretty and helps organize the HTML.  I felt that this was a worthwhile addition, and it's fairly lightweight.  If you want to establish a new theme, read the docs.  Note that you'll need a globally installed Nodejs (including npm) and gulp.  Gulp also requires a local install too (I know, it's lame.  Sorry.)

If you want to rebuild the dist css, enter the semantic directory and type "gulp build".  I was new to Semantic, so everything I know is in the docs.  They're not bad.

3.  Why not Python for the backend?

I know most of the team knows python, so I heavily considered using Django for this website.  But I figured that a higher proportion of web people know Javascript than proportion of python people in DSC club know websites with Python.

4.  Who are you?  How do I reach you?

My name is Aaron Chan, I'm a junior (secretly a freshman) at BYU, and I'm probably on a mission right now, otherwise I'd be the one maintaining the website.  Sorry.  I'm trying to write everything I know into documentation like this.  Jacob (head of DSC club atm) will probably be well-informed about this by myself, but he's graduating.  Hopefully the code is clear enough for you.  I tried to make it as semantic and logical as possible.
