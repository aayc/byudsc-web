It will be good for us to compete as a club so that we can all help each other out. Also, if we win, there is a $20,000 prize. This competition will end in about one month on February 8th.</p><p><b>Competition Goal before next week</b></p><p>The goal that we set as a team for the competition is the following: Experienced people: make at least one code submission, even if it's naiive and not super good.
