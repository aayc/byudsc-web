        <h2><b>What problem does this solve?</b></h2>
        <p>Editing HTML pages and knowing where to put them, and especially how to link them together, is a pain!  Write your HTML here (or write it in a text editor - vim, Sublimetext, whatever, and paste it here) and let the admin panel do the linking work for you.</p>
        <h2><b>What's in here?</b></h2>
        <p>There are two main modules - the Technique and Event managers (write up manager coming soon!).   The Technique manager lets you a) create articles and post them under categories, b) create and delete categories, and delete articles.  The Event manager lets you a) create events and post them under date categories, b) create and delete categories, and delete events.</p>
        <h2><b>How does the Admin panel work, technically speaking?</b></h2>
        <p>Different panels work differently.  The Events panel pushes the events you create into events.json.  Nodejs pulls from events.json to create the static HTML page you see in the Events tab of the main website.</p>
        <h2><b>What if I lose my data?</b></h2>
        <p>I trust you.  Make backups.  I provided a backup utilities for you.  One of them (backup-the-json.py) will zip the current state of the json files and place it into the json-backup folder.  Use this liberally.</p>
